<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey you! My name is Natasha. I am from South Georgia. I have two amazing daughters. I've been working in the healthcare field for over a decade. Ever since high school, I've always dreamed of becoming a Software Engineer. You can say procrastination and imposter syndrome was the cause of my defeat. In addition, life has been stressful. </p>
<p>Guess what? Even though I felt defeated, I wouldn't answer to my doubts. Something about this particular field keeps bringing me back. I am not the most creative person but I try to find inspiration by paying attention to the websites I visit.</p>
<p>I look forward to this journey. Failure doesn't mean I quit. Failure is a delay in one's journey. On that note, follow my journey...</p>
